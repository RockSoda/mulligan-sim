## Mulligan Simulator for MTG Arena
For Magic the Gathering: Arena the card game.

Since I have heard a lot of people complained how rigged the shuffler is in Magic the Gathering: Arena. That's why I make this program, to test if the shuffling result is somewhat similar to the game. To use the program, export your deck code from Magic the Gathering: Arena, copy it to the input box to get a starting hand.
